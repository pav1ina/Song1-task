Death, she must have been your will
A bone beneath the reaper's veil
With your voice my belly sunk
And I began to feel so drunk

Candle, candle, on my clock
Oh Lord, I must have heard you knock me out of bed
As the flames licked my head
And my lungs filled up black in their tiny little shack
It was real and I repent
All those messages you sent, clear as day, but in the night
Oh, I couldn't get it right
